2002 - sce api.txt,Ambiguity,The SceMiInfoType is an extra piece of information that indicates if the message is a warning or just some informational status.

2002 - sce api.txt,Ambiguity,Proper usage of this callback is to process the data quickly and return as soon as possible.
2002 - sce api.txt,Ambiguity,"Typically in a SystemC context, the callback might do some minor manipulation to the context object then immediately return and let a suspended thread resume and do the main processing of the received transaction."
2002 - sce api.txt,Ambiguity,"This is because if an error occurs within the SceMi::ServiceLoop() function (from which the receive callback is normally called), the callback is never called in the first place and standard error handling procedures (see 4.3.2.1 on page62) are followed by the service loop function itself."

national vs. pan-European needs Executive summary According to the Description of work of PEPPOL, the overall aim of work package 2 (Virtual Company Dossier – VCD) is “to provide interoperable solutions for economic operators in any European country to utilise company information already registered somewhere and to submit this information electronically to any public sector awarding entity from a different Member State when these economic operators decide to apply for public contracts”."

2009 - peppol.txt,Ambiguity,A major challenge of PEPPOLs’ work package 2 is to integrate various stakeholders in the development process and to set up an IT system which supports a common set of evidences based on electronic business certificates and qualification documents that are most frequently required.

2009 - peppol.txt,Ambiguity,For the overall activity it will be important to have the appropriate legal support in order to ensure legitimacy of mappings.
2009 - peppol.txt,Vagueness,• A template that ensures comparable and reliable mappings between criteria for qualitative selection and exclusion and national attestations MUST be defined.
