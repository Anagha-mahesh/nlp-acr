Specification (SRS) identifies the requirements for the ASPERA-3 Processing and Archiving Facility (APAF) ground data system for the Mars Express mission. 1.1 Project Identification Project Title: ASPERA for Mars Express Project Number: 15-02853 / 15-03561 Contract Number: NASW-99030 / NASW-00003 Principal Investigator: Winningham, John D. Project Manager: Scherrer, John R. Software Project Manager: Jeffers, Sandee J. Start Date: June 14, 1999 End Date: September 30, 2007 1.2 Data System Overview The ASPERA-3 instrument package (or ASPERA-3 experiment) will be flown on the Mars Express mission of the European Space Agency (ESA) and will be launched in June 2003 according to the current schedule. ASPERA-3 contains a number of different sensors that will measure the particles, neutral atoms, and fields in the near Martian environment. Southwest Research Institute is providing the data system to produce data products in a form suitable for analysis and archiving. These data products will be put into a form known as the Instrument Data File Set (IDFS). The ASPERA-3 Processing and Archiving Facility (APAF) is a ground data system responsible for processing all of the ASPERA-3 telemetry. The APAF data system acquires the telemetry data via NISN, processes the data into IDFS data sets, distributes the IDFS data sets to the ASPERA-3 team, provides web-based displays of the most current data for public view, stores the telemetry and IDFS data sets on a local SwRI archive, and submits the ASPERA-3 IDFS data sets to PDS for long-term archival. The first step in defining the IDFS data sets is to identify the physical instruments that make up the ASPERA-3 experiment and any ancillary data necessary for scientific analysis. There are six components of the ASPERA-3 package, plus the orbit and attitude data from the spacecraft: 1. Data Processing Unit (DPU) 2. Electron Spectrometer (ELS) 3. Ion Mass Analyzer (IMA) 4. Neutral Particle Detector (NPD) 5. Neutral Particle Imager (NPI) 6. Scanning Unit (SU) 7. Orbit/Attitude (OA) Each of the physical components will be divided into logical groups (called virtual instruments) in which each logical group will be formatted as an IDFS data set. Each of the seven components described above SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS SPECIFICATION 1 April 24, 2001 APAF-SRS-15-03561-V1.0 will have an associated Software Design Document (SDD) that will define and fully describe all of the data products contained within each individual virtual instrument. 1.3 Goals and Objectives The APAF ground data system is to provide data processing algorithms and support to IRF for the ASPERA-3 science team (including Co-I’s) in preparation for the Mission Operations and Data Analysis (MO&DA) phase of the Mars Express mission. In addition, validation and archiving of all ASPERA-3 scientific data in the NASA Planetary Data System (PDS) within 6 months of receipt in a form useable by the general scientific community is to be provided by the APAF. 1.4 Document Overview Section 2 is an overview of the descriptions of requirement determination, qualification procedures, rationale, and traceability that are used in the identification and the definitions of the requirements. The requirements of the APAF data system are categorized and defined in Section 3. Section 4 contains general information to aid in the understanding of this specification. 1.5 Related Documents Program-Level Requirements for the ASPERA-3 Mission of Opportunity Project: approved Nov. 1999 APAF Software Development Plan: APAF-SDP-15-02853, Version 1.2 released November 27, 2000 APAF Project Data Management Plan: APAF-PDMP-15-03561, Version 1.1 released December 29, 2000 APAF Data System Interface Document: APAF-DSID-15-03561, Version 1.0 released August 18, 2000 ESA Mars Express Space / Ground Interface Control Document (SGICD): ME-ESC-IF-5001, Issue 1, May 1999 ESOC Data Disposition system Interface control Document (DDID): to be released sometime 2000 ASPERA-3 Packet Definitions: from FMI and UMU, preliminary document from FMI issued July 2000 ELS Software Design Document: ELS-SDD-15-03561, Version 1.0 to be released December 15, 2001 IMA Software Design Document: IMA-SDD-15-03561, Version 1.0 to be released December 15, 2001 NPD Software Design Document: NPD-SDD-15-03561, Version 1.0 to be released December 15, 2001 NPI Software Design Document: NPI-SDD-15-03561, Version 1.0 to be released December 15, 2001 DPU Software Design Document: DPU-SDD-15-03561, Version 1.0 to be released September 1, 2002 SU Software Design Document: SU-SDD-15-03561, Version 1.0 to be released September 1, 2002 OA Software Design Document: OA-SDD-15-03561, Version 1.0 to be released September 1, 2002 APAF System Design Document: APAF-SDD-15-03561, Version 1.0 to be released December 4, 2002 APAF Operations Procedures: APAF-OPD-15-03561, Version 1.0 to be released May 23, 2003 SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS SPECIFICATION 2 April 24, 2001 APAF-SRS-15-03561-V1.0 2.0 REQUIREMENTS SPECIFICATION DESCRIPTIONS 2.1 Requirement Identification Each requirement shall be: • Necessary: It states a condition for the acceptance of the system. • Verifiable: It is stated in such a way that an objective test can be defined for it. • Attainable: It is technically feasible and can be accomplished within schedule and budget. • Clear: It is singular, concise, and simple. Each requirement shall be: • assigned a project-unique identifier. • annotated with associated qualification (verification) methods (see section 2.2). • annotated with rationale (see section 2.3). • annotated with associated traceability to their source (see section 2.4). 2.2 Qualification Provisions For each requirement in Section 3, the method(s) to be used to verify that the requirement has been met is annotated. Qualification methods included in this specification are: • Demonstration: observing function of the system without requiring instrumentation, special test equipment, or subsequent analysis. • Analysis: processing accumulated data obtained during characterization, calibration, or testing of the instrumentation. For example, simulated instrument data sets can be created from the accumulated calibration and test data by putting this data into the expected telemetry format that will be input into the APAF data system. These simulated data sets can then be processed into IDFS data sets and the Southwest Data Display and Analysis System (SDDAS) can be used to analyze the output from the APAF data system. 2.3 Rationale The rationale behind each requirement is documented, if applicable, in Section 3 along with each requirement. Rationale may include: • assumptions • why a requirement is needed • how a requirement is related to expected operations • design decisions made at higher system levels 2.4 Requirements Traceability The relationship between each requirement and the project item(s) that it addresses is documented along with each requirement identified in Section 3. A requirement may address any number of project items including a system-level requirement, a customer request document (e.g., an RFP), a proposal, or other documentation.

These are taken directly from the Program-Level Requirements for the ASPERA-3 Mission of Opportunity Project which is an appendix to the NASA Discovery Program Plan. In Section 4.1.1, Baseline Science Requirements, it states: “…the ASPERA-3 MO shall provide the complete data set of the integrated ASPERA-3 investigation to all ASPERA-3 Co-I’s and the NASA Planetary Data System (PDS). The specific measurements delivered shall be as follows: 4.1.1.1 Measure integral ENA fluxes in the energy range of 0.1 to 60 keV. 4.1.1.2 Measure mass/energy resolved neutral hydrogen and oxygen atom spectra in the energy range of 0.1 to 100 keV. 4.1.1.3 Measure ion energy/mass/angle resolved spectra in the energy range of 0.001 to 40 keV; 1-1e6 atomic mass units per unit charge (amu/q); with 4pi steradian coverage. 4.1.1.4 Measure the electron spectra in the energy range of 0.001 to 20 keV, with 4pi steradian coverage. 4.1.1.5 Measure ions and electrons in the energy range of 0.001 to 40 keV; 1-1e6 amu/q.” In Section 4.3, Launch Requirements, it states: “…data processing software shall meet the delivery requirements of the IRF in order to support the launch date and operation of the ESA Mars Express mission.” In Section 4.4, Ground System Requirements, it states: “SwRI shall develop the ASPERA-3 data reduction system and software to be used during instrument integration, test, calibration and mission operations for the full ASPERA-3 experiment. This task will include interfacing with all ASPERA-3 sensor teams to determine and effect data packetization and storage strategies. This system shall be available on a schedule to satisfy the mission needs per agreement with IRF, and to satisfy the data availability requirements established in Section 4.5.1. SwRI shall provide processing algorithms to IRF in preparation for the mission operations and data analysis phase of Mars Express on a schedule to satisfy the mission needs per agreement with IRF.” In Section 4.5.1, Science Data Management, it states: “…the ASPERA-3 MO PI shall be responsible for collecting engineering and ancillary information necessary to validate and calibrate the scientific data prior to depositing it in the NASA PDS in a PDS-compliant form. The time required to complete this process shall be the minimum necessary to provide accurate scientific data to the science community and the general public, but it shall not exceed six months after acquisition.” SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS SPECIFICATION 1 1 April 24, 2001 APAF-SRS-15-03561-V1.0 In Section 4.5.2, Analysis Software, it states: “Science analysis software developed by the ASPERA-3 MO PI team for this project shall be integrated into the NASA approved data repository. The PI team and the science community shall have equal on-line access to this software.” In Section 4.5.3, Data Management Plan, it states: “The ASPERA-3 MO Project shall develop a project data management plan to address the total activity associated with the flow of science data, including planning, acquisition, processing, data product generation and validation, archiving, and preservation. The plan shall identify science and supplementary data products, systems associated with handling the data, and the roles, responsibilities, and operational interfaces affecting those data and systems.” Note: This Program-Level requirement has been met with the generation and delivery of the APAF Project Data Management Plan (PDMP).
