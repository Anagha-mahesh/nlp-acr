Page iii Clarus Weather System Design Detailed System Requirements Specification 1 INTRODUCTION 1.1 Purpose The purpose of this requirements specification is to provide a repository for the high-level and detailed requirements governing the design of the Clarus system. These requirements capture the expression of general needs in the Clarus Concept of Operations (ConOps), in meetings with potential users and participants, and in subsequent documents identified below. These requirements will form the basis for the design verification and validation of the system. The intended audience for this document includes decision makers, stakeholders, designers, and testers. This document may be updated periodically to reflect changes in the system requirements, including changes reflected in subsequent versions of the system. As indicated in the highlighted box in Figure 1, the Detailed Systems Requirements Specification (DRS) is an intermediate deliverable in the larger context of the Clarus Weather System Design project, using criteria documented in the Concept of Operations, High-Level Requirements Specification, Survey of Environmental Sensor Stations, Analysis of COTS Systems, Analysis Architectural Alternatives Analysis, and the Design Gaps Analysis as input to the DRS. 04037-rq301srs0200 Copyright © 2005 Mixon/Hill, Inc.

Page 2 Clarus Weather System Design Detailed System Requirements Specification 1.2 Scope Clarus is an initiative sponsored by the U.S. Department of Transportation (U.S. DOT) to organize and make more effective environmental and road condition observation capabilities in support of four primary motivations. 1) Provide a North American resource to collect, quality check, and make available surface transportation weather and road condition observations so that State Departments of Transportation (DOTs) and other transportation agencies can be more productive in maintaining safety and mobility on all roads and surface transportation platforms. In addition to increasing productivity, it will maximize their RWIS/ESS investments. 2) Surface transportation-based weather observations will enhance and extend the existing weather data sources that support general purpose weather forecasting for the protection of life and property. 3) Collection of real-time surface transportation-based weather observations will support real-time operational responses to weather. 4) Surface transportation-based weather observations integrated with existing observation data will permit broader support for the enhancement and creation of models that make better predictions in the atmospheric boundary layer and near the earth’s surface to support more accurate forecasts. The intent of the Clarus Initiative is to demonstrate how an open and integrated approach to observational data management can be used to collect, control the quality of, and consolidate surface transportation environmental data. The Clarus Initiative will address the necessary infrastructure to consolidate the data from a multitude of independent data collection systems. This process offers the prospect of enhancing data coverage, improving the performance of meteorological support services, and providing guidance to owners of these data sources regarding the quality of their data and performance of their data collection systems. Clarus represents the next step in bringing together surface transportation best practices and the greater weather community. Surface transportation environmental data collected by the Clarus system will include atmospheric data, pavement data1, and hydrologic (water level) data. The Clarus Initiative consists of two development components. • The first component is the development of the Clarus system – a network for sharing, quality checking, and exchanging surface environmental data and relevant surface transportation conditions. • The second component is the development of tools (such as decision support systems) that make effective use of the Clarus system. 1 “Pavement data” in this context includes surface and subsurface data specified in NTCIP 1204 (Ref. 8). 04037-rq301srs0200 Copyright © 2005 Mixon/Hill, Inc. All rights reserved. Page 3 Clarus Weather System Design Detailed System Requirements Specification The addition of Clarus system data to national weather observations will further enhance general purpose weather forecasting, providing a wider range of benefits to the protection of life and property. Data from the Clarus system will have a wide variety of direct and indirect uses. Users having the most immediate contact with the Clarus system will include the owners and operators of the observing systems that are providing information to the Clarus system, as well as the users directly accessing the data contained within the Clarus system. The following is an initial list — which will likely grow as the initiative progresses — of these stakeholders: • Observation system owners including federal, state, local, and private institutions; • Instrument and observation platform suppliers; • Direct data users including system owners and their contractors; • Surface transportation weather service providers (which may include the observation system owners – e.g., state DOTs); • The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA); • General weather service providers; • Research and engineering community; and • Climate data warehouse and other non-surface weather interests. The deployed Clarus system is envisioned to include: • A one-stop Internet portal for all surface transportation environmental observations; • Data provided with and without post-processing, ready to be incorporated into value-added products including weather and traffic models as well as decision support systems; • Continuous quality checking of data with feedback to operators of the originating sensor stations; • Data transferred in one common protocol with full metadata; • Management of users’ rights to input or extract specific data components; • Data retrieval tools; and • Support for the inclusion of new technologies such as vehicle-based sensors, surface visibility information from traffic cameras, and remote sensing technologies. 1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations This document may contain terms, acronyms, and abbreviations that are unfamiliar to the reader.

Some portions of the Clarus Concept of Operations (Ref. 12) have been incorporated in this document, both for continuity of concept, and to help identify the basis for the high-level and detailed requirements. Specific attributions of this content are only included where they enhance the context of the requirements. 1.5 Overview The organization and content of this document is generally based on the IEEE standards for System Requirements Specifications (Ref. 13). The requirements presented in this document represent the high-level and detailed objectives, constraints, and desires for the Clarus system. Each requirement is identified by a unique Clarus-specific identifier to allow the requirement to be referenced in future documents, providing traceability throughout the development process. Each detailed requirement is traced to its parent through its identification number followed by a unique identifier. A requirements document states what must be accomplished to fulfill the vision described in a concept of operations. It does not state how it is to be accomplished. This document describes each requirement and the basis for inclusion of that requirement. The remaining sections of the document contain the requirements for the system. The sections and their content are as follows: Section 2 – General Description provides a general overview of the entire system. This section describes the general factors that affect the system and its requirements. Section 3 – System Architecture provides an overview of the Clarus system’s components and their functions. Specific requirements in the next section are allocated to and organized according to these components. Section 4 – Specific Requirements contains the requirements developed from reference documentation and stakeholder communications. This section organizes the requirements into categories that facilitate the system 04037-rq301srs0200 Copyright © 2005 Mixon/Hill, Inc. All rights reserved.

The categories in this document are: Configuration & Administration Service (CAS), Configuration & Administration User Interface (CAUI), Collector Services (CS), Watchdog (DOG), Environmental Metadata Cache (EMC), Environmental Metadata Services (EMS), Qualified Environmental Data (QEDC), Qualified Environmental Data Services (QEDS), Quality Checking Services (QChS), Schedule Service (SS), and program requirements. 04037-rq301srs0200 Copyright © 2005 Mixon/Hill, Inc.

Page 7 Clarus Weather System Design Detailed System Requirements Specification 2 GENERAL DESCRIPTION This section provides an overview of the entire system and describes the general factors that affect the system and its requirements. This section does not state specific requirements, but instead is intended to make the requirements easier to understand by giving them context. That context and the overall intent of the Clarus program are described in detail in the Clarus Concept of Operations (Ref. 12), from which much of the description in this section was derived. 2.1 System Perspective The Clarus Initiative is essentially a plan to create a “network of networks” — much like the Internet — for surface transportation environmental data. While the Internet is an interconnection of computer networks, Clarus will be an interconnection of environmental (weather, pavement, and water level condition) data collection networks. Each of the weather networks will function autonomously; they will collect information and disseminate it internally without direction or dependence on Clarus. Each participating weather network’s connection to Clarus will add two new possible modes of functionality. First, the participants will be able to share collected environmental data with Clarus. Second, participants will be able to receive environmental data collected by Clarus. The primary recipients of this data will be weather service providers, but any Clarus participants would be able to receive data if they so chose. This concept of autonomous data sharing is comparable to the World Wide Web layer of the Internet, where organizations can publish information on web pages, or browse and download information published by other organizations on the web. Ownership of the data is retained by the organization that provided the data to Clarus, and the provider organization can restrict the dissemination of the data through data sharing agreements with the Clarus program. The Clarus system will add a third mode of functionality, which might be called “meta-librarian.” The Clarus system will collect, organize, and quality check the environmental data to be published by the system. The data will be collected from the participants, organized by location and type of data, and quality flags will be added. When this is done, the data will be published to the Service Providers and other participant/consumers in Clarus. Figure 2 shows the general process as data progresses from collection through publication to service providers. 04037-rq301srs0200 Copyright © 2005 Mixon/Hill, Inc. All rights reserved. Page 8 Clarus Weather System Design Detailed System Requirements Specification Data Collection Systems Service Providers Data Collection Systems Clarus Data Collection Systems Field Instrumentation and Remote Sensing Service Provider Customers Figure 2 – Clarus Data Acquisition, Processing, and Publication The principal interfaces that will be critical to Clarus are the interface between Clarus and the participating collectors, and the interface between Clarus and the participating service providers. MADIS, for example, uses NetCDF files as a standard interchange format. While the service provider interface is completely within the control of the Clarus Initiative, the interface(s) to the collectors may be influenced by what interfaces these systems can support. While the participants may want to access the network through “a one-stop Internet portal for all surface transportation weather and pavement related observations” (Ref. 12), there is no requirement that the system be a single centralized system. Designers are free to explore centralized and de-centralized architectures so long as the interfaces with participants give the appearance of a “one-stop” portal. The issues of data retention and archive are also not explicitly addressed. While some data retention is likely to be necessary to support the quality checking function and the publication function, there is a clear recognition that as the data age, they lose value to all but climatological investigators and other researchers. This phase of development does not include directly archiving the large volume of environmental data in Clarus. Considering the technical scope of such an effort, archiving may be externalized or be deferred until the Clarus network is operational and proven. 04037-rq301srs0200 Copyright © 2005 Mixon/Hill, Inc.

Page 9 Clarus Weather System Design Detailed System Requirements Specification 2.2 System Functions The Clarus system will collect data from contributing members, organize and quality check the data, and then publish the data for use by service providers and other members of the network. These basic processes are shown in Figure 3 in terms of Clarus system objects and their interactions. The ellipses represent specific types of data, user roles, or equipment, and the arrows represent the interactions between them2. For example, a “Collector” administers a “Sensor,” collects “Observation Data,” provides “Sensor Metadata,” and receives “Quality Feedback”. 2 The arrows in Figure 3 do not indicate data flows; they show the subject-object orientation of the relationship. 04037-rq301srs0200 Copyright © 2005 Mixon/Hill, Inc.

All rights reserved. Page 11 Clarus Weather System Design Detailed System Requirements Specification The volume of data involved in this process has the potential to become very large, which leads to a significant challenge in developing a system that can effectively gather, organize, quality check, and disseminate the data. The Clarus system should be a data collection system capable of handling a vast range of data in a flexible manner that permits new data types to be added. Determining data types will be a significant challenge. Proper understanding of the available data versus the required information will dictate how the data gathering processes and the database itself should be designed for greatest efficiency. While there are many types of environmental data that could be collected, the Clarus emphasis on surface weather and transportation puts the focus on those weather elements that have a direct bearing on surface transportation systems. These environmental data elements are described in the NTCIP 1204 standard for Environmental Sensor Station (ESS) interfaces (Ref. 8) and summarized in Table 1 as potential environmental data elements to include in the Clarus system. 04037-rq301srs0200 Copyright © 2005 Mixon/Hill, Inc.

There is also a period for which the Service Provider Customers have temporal-driven requirements. The design of Clarus will need to consider these time horizons when planning the technical limitations of the system architecture. These data time horizons are illustrated in Figure 4. 04037-rq301srs0200 Copyright © 2005 Mixon/Hill, Inc. All rights reserved. Page 13 Clarus Weather System Design Detailed System Requirements Specification Figure 4 – Time Horizons for Weather Data The average elapsed time for the Autonomous Layer varies as a result of configuration and communications latencies that are inherent within the operation of the system to collect the data. The Clarus component includes the time required to communicate data from the Autonomous Layer to the Clarus system import process as well as the time required to process the input data into storage structures. Further, the variation in the Service Provider component includes the time required to add other data to the Clarus data and to perform the human- and machine-based product generation. The average data age grows as a result of the aggregated times required to move through the various layers and eventually to the Service Provider Customers. The Clarus system design must address how best to minimize these times to optimize the flow of data in a timely manner. For the purposes of defining the boundaries of these time horizons, the following definitions apply: • Average Elapsed Time is the estimated time for the process within a given layer or layer subdivision to take place. The age of observed and recorded values can vary widely within these bands. • Average Data Age is the estimated average age of an ESS observation as it is transferred from the ESS to the end user. 04037-rq301srs0200 Copyright © 2005 Mixon/Hill, Inc. All rights reserved. Page 14 Clarus Weather System Design Detailed System Requirements Specification 2.3 User Characteristics Direct and indirect use of the Clarus system can be applied to a wide audience. Because a variety of users can derive benefit from the Clarus system, it is necessary to focus upon those users who have the most immediate contact with the system components. The primary user classes include the owners and operators of the observing systems collecting and sending information to Clarus, and the users directly accessing the data published by the Clarus system. The following is an initial list of stakeholders whose user needs are considered: • Observation system owners including federal, state, local, and private institutions; • Instrument and observation platform suppliers; • Direct data users including system owners and their contractors; • Surface transportation weather service providers (which may include the observation system owners); • NOAA; • General weather service providers; • Research and engineering community; and • Climate data warehouse and other non-surface weather interests. This list of direct users of data from the Clarus system is a subset of the entire population of stakeholders interested in the Clarus Initiative. The requirements of the broader stakeholder community are essential to the Clarus Initiative and these interests must serve as a framework for the core Clarus system. From information in the Surface Transportation Weather Decision Support Requirements (STWDSR) (Ref. 5), Weather Information for Surface Transportation (WIST) (Ref. 6), and 511 Deployment Coalition (Ref. 7) documents, it is possible to separate stakeholder groups into a condensed list based upon the user’s interface or interaction with Clarus data. The users are viewed as defining layers in the process of transferring data from raw field observations to various levels of data use. This is illustrated in Figure 5. 04037-rq301srs0200 Copyright © 2005 Mixon/Hill, Inc. All rights reserved.

These data include observations collected by ESS, mobile data acquisition platforms, cameras, and other transportation-related measurement devices. The Autonomous Layer data comprises the vast majority of the raw input data to the Clarus system. The Clarus Layer lies between the Autonomous and Service Providers Layers and represents the nationwide system and architecture to accomplish the previously outlined goals of surface transportation environmental data collection and management. The Service Providers Layer is composed of both public and private entities that provide basic and value-added weather support services to support the weather information needs of the broader surface transportation community. These support services rely on Clarus data (raw and processed) combined with other 04037-rq301srs0200 Copyright © 2005 Mixon/Hill, Inc. All rights reserved. Page 16 Clarus Weather System Design Detailed System Requirements Specification environmental, road condition, or traffic information products to develop or provide road weather information and enhanced products. The Service Provider Customer Layer includes those groups who are direct consumers of products generated by Service Providers and are generally not a direct user of Clarus data. The members of this group could be anyone using weather information, but are largely found within the surface transportation community. The weather products received by these end users are built from a combination of Clarus and non-Clarus data. In some instances, the Service Provider Customer Layer includes entities and agencies also found within the Autonomous Layer who receive quality checking information on the data they originally provided to Clarus. Figure 5 can also be viewed as a depiction of the time horizons that separate the stakeholder groups. There is an inherent time scale, similar to Figure 4, emanating from the center of the diagram outward, representing the flow and processing of data through the Clarus system and between the layers. The context diagram in Figure 6 illustrates the relationship of the entities interfacing with Clarus. The diagram also describes the flow of data between the entities and the Clarus system. The data provider organizations maintain data collection systems. These organizations make up the Autonomous Layer — the primary contributors of surface transportation data to the Clarus system. These stakeholders can benefit from Clarus by receiving quality-controlled data from the Clarus system. The quality-controlled data are not value-added data, but data with flags indicating that elements do not meet quality checking thresholds. Figure 6 – Context Diagram of Clarus User Needs 04037-rq301srs0200 Copyright © 2005 Mixon/Hill, Inc. All rights reserved. Page 17 Clarus Weather System Design Detailed System Requirements Specification The private and public sector Service Providers are the principal Clarus users. These Service Providers generate value-added road and rail weather information services for the transportation community. Additional Service Providers having direct access to Clarus data resources include research organizations, external agencies that may choose to archive Clarus data, and other related weather service providers. Within the context of Figure 6, the following roles can be assigned to each group of users: • Federal, State, and Local Agencies – These are the transportation system and road weather information system (RWIS) operators and owners who directly provide the Clarus data. This group places considerable emphasis on the pavement-specific component of the data at the observational level to make immediate decisions. These users, primarily maintenance and operations personnel, are the principal consumers of information provided by surface transportation weather service providers. Additional data from this group may include closed circuit television (CCTV) images, road condition information, and records of treatment activities such as plowing and chemical application. • Transit – These are the owners and operators of transit systems who contribute raw data to the Clarus system and may receive quality- controlled data from it. This group places considerable emphasis on understanding weather conditions along designated routes. • Rail – These are the owners and operators of rail systems who contribute raw data to the Clarus system and may receive quality-controlled data from it. This group places considerable emphasis on understanding weather conditions along designated routes plus weather-induced specifics such as rail temperatures, frozen switches, icing on electrical power distribution systems, and drifting snow. • Vehicle – Emerging technologies are developing that will encourage a greater level of data collection from vehicles for the purpose of understanding the nature of the transportation system state including the impacts of weather. As this method of data collection matures, the information obtained on weather and pavement conditions from instrumentation on-board vehicles will be important Clarus data. • Surface Transportation Weather Service Providers (STWSP) – These surface transportation weather service providers are the private and public weather service providers who assimilate the Clarus data with other available data to generate value-added products and services used by the surface transportation decision-makers at state and local transportation agencies. • Weather Service Providers – These include the weather support services that are primarily interested in the meteorological and hydrologic components of the Clarus data. This group includes the efforts in public forecasting by NOAA and the National Weather Service (NWS) along 04037-rq301srs0200 Copyright © 2005 Mixon/Hill, Inc. All rights reserved. Page 18 Clarus Weather System Design Detailed System Requirements Specification with private sector weather services and their value-added support to markets such as agriculture, power utilities, and construction. • Research – This category incorporates federal, academic, and private sector researchers who are working to improve the state of knowledge and practice through the research of surface transportation weather. • Archives – This category includes operational and non-operational interests who choose to include the Clarus data in their endeavors. The archiving of Clarus data will be most effective when combined with other meteorological archives beyond the scope of Clarus, but is not restricted to such efforts. 2.4 General Constraints Timeliness of information and reliability of the system are major constraints on the design. Both of these factors can be addressed through appropriate system architecture and implementation. To address the timeliness factor, the system should be designed such that it can both retrieve and disseminate large volumes of data from a variety of sources and at potentially high rates. An architecture that spreads its data collection and dissemination processes across multiple servers and communication channels may address this issue. The inherent scalability of such a design may also enable the system to expand and add new data sources and end-users. Reliability can be achieved through a variety of design and deployment considerations. Hardware, operating system, and development environment have significant impacts on the inherent reliability of the system. To maximize system uptime, redundancies may be required at both the hardware and software levels of the system. The primary challenge here will be the trade-off between the desire for reliability and the cost of redundancies. While the availability of the system is covered in the Concept of Operations, the criticality of the system is not explicitly addressed. Since Clarus is not replacing any existing application, the system is not currently critical to any operation or transportation function; neither is it intended to support any “critical national security missions.”3 Nonetheless, once the Clarus system is operational, many DOTs will use the environmental data from the Clarus system in their normal management and operations of their infrastructure. If the Clarus system fails, requestors will need to use their legacy systems. The system will be “open,” using architecture and communications interfaces that are non-proprietary and broadly supported within the information technology industry. The system should be standards based, where national standards are applicable. Special consideration should be given to the national intelligent transportation system (ITS) standards. 3 Security considerations for the Clarus system fall under the guidance of Reference 14, OMB Circular No. A-130, which, by its own definition, does not apply to “critical national security missions.” Future applications of Clarus may necessitate revisiting this classification. 04037-rq301srs0200 Copyright © 2005 Mixon/Hill, Inc.

Page 19 Clarus Weather System Design Detailed System Requirements Specification 2.5 Assumptions and Dependencies The usefulness of the Clarus system is dependent on participation by multiple environmental data providers and multiple environmental data consumers. While the system could be placed in operation with data from only a single contributing network, there is no added value without the participation of other weather data sources. Likewise, participation by a small number of data consumers would not justify the cost of operating the system. Several assumptions have been made as to how long it will take environmental data contributors to collect, process, and publish their data. Data not collected in a timely manner may be of limited use to the data consumers. Assumptions have also been made about the accuracy of the data, and the ability of the contributing systems to provide adequate location, time/date, and data qualification tags. Accepting data from contributors who cannot provide these tags with the data could seriously complicate the design of the data acquisition interfaces. Even though the system will check the data and apply quality flags, consumers of Clarus-provided data will need to understand that neither FHWA nor the contributing data providers will accept responsibility for the accuracy of any of the data. The particular limitations and conditions will be defined in data sharing agreements to be established with data providers, and disclaimer information will be made available to data consumers by whatever means the data are published. Several requirements deal with “regional” needs, without specifying regional boundaries. It is unlikely that the regional boundaries from contributing systems will correspond with the regional boundaries defined within data consumer systems. It is even likely that participating data contributors will have different (though possibly overlapping) coverage areas for their networks. Data consumers will need to understand that data will be presented by geographic coordinates, not by regional boundaries. Consumers will also need to understand that coverage will not be uniform and will depend on sensor placement by the contributing organizations. The availability, format, and precision of geo-reference coordinates for data collection points could present unusual problems for the data acquisition system. Data in the system database and in published data sets will likely include geo- reference coordinates in decimal longitude, latitude, and elevation. The availability, format, and precision of time/date stamps could also present unusual problems for the data acquisition system, particularly if contributing systems cannot manage Daylight Savings Time (DST), span time zones, or span areas that do and do not participate in DST. Clarus timestamps for data in the database and in published data sets need to be referenced to a standard time reference such as Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The base assumption regarding “database tools” is that the selected data storage software will include appropriate programming interfaces, query tools, and configuration and management tools. No special database tools will be developed as a part of the Clarus system. Some tools may developed in the future as part of ongoing Clarus Initiative activities. 04037-rq301srs0200 Copyright © 2005 Mixon/Hill, Inc. All rights reserved. Page 20 Clarus Weather System Design Detailed System Requirements Specification 3 SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE The process of generating detailed system requirements has two major parts: allocating the high-level requirements to specific system components, and elaborating the requirements on the function and interchange between those components. The functional components of the Clarus system have been detailed in the Clarus System Architectural Description and are summarized in this section. Figure 7, taken from that document, represents the general structure and flow of information within the Clarus system.

The collector, QED, and EM services are sets of services because each individual service represents a particular data format interface. A set of services is required to properly interpret and transform all the incoming and outgoing environmental information. The particular collector, QED, or EM service performing a transformation depends on the origin and destination of the environmental data. The fourth component modeled as a set is the quality checking service. It is a set of services because it represents in one component all the QCh algorithms that can be applied to environmental data collected by Clarus. The specific algorithms and sequence in which they are applied are determined by quality rules established through the configuration & administration service. This arrangement supports flexibility in adding and removing QCh algorithms to produce the best possible qualified environmental data in the Clarus system. 04037-rq301srs0200 Copyright © 2005 Mixon/Hill, Inc. All rights reserved. Page 21 Clarus Weather System Design Detailed System Requirements Specification There are two services that keep the Clarus system operating: the watchdog and schedule services. The watchdog service monitors the overall system state and restarts unresponsive services as needed, thus preventing long-term service disruption. The schedule service prioritizes requests to receive environmental data from collectors and contributors. The schedule service will also prioritize and respond to subscription requests for environmental data (not depicted in Figure 7). The set of collector services in the Clarus system receives environmental data from ED collectors and contributors through both push and pull methods. Each collector service is capable of understanding a particular data format and is responsible for extracting the environmental data and placing it into the qualified environmental data cache flagged as unqualified environmental data. Quality rules set up by the configuration & administration service are executed by the quality checking services to apply sets of computations on the environmental data stored in the qualified environmental data cache. Flagging out-of-range values is one example of a quality rule. Other quality rules could be created to derive environmental conditions from existing information such as dew point. Multiple passes by the quality checking services on the QEDC information could apply grid algorithms sequentially to further quality check the environmental data. This allows constant access to qualified environmental data in-process. The QEDC is still valuable to end-users since it will always identify its level of quality and can be continuously delivered. The QED services format the qualified environmental data to fulfill requests from and information subscriptions for environmental service providers and end-users. Similarly, the EM services format the metadata to meet requests from and metadata subscriptions for environmental service providers. Each of these components is a set of services, with each individual service supporting a particular data format. The configuration and administration service supports both the Clarus system and program. It maintains information about data provider redistribution restrictions and controls who has access to modify the system state, quality rules, and set ED retrieval schedules. The configuration & administration service manages environ- mental metadata, formatting it for internal storage. Data transactions and system operational statistics are logged in the configuration and administration user interface as well. The configuration and administration user interface allows administrative users to interact with these functions and supports the manual quality review processes. 04037-rq301srs0200 Copyright © 2005 Mixon/Hill, Inc.

Page 22 Clarus Weather System Design Detailed System Requirements Specification 4 SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS This section presents the high-level and detailed requirements for the Clarus system and the associated institutional program necessary to achieve the needs and goals described by the Concept of Operations. These requirements describe the expected attributes and capabilities of the system and allocate capabilities to specific components within the Clarus system. The high-level requirements in this document are limited to those that can be derived from a context diagram (Figure 8) that pictures the Clarus system as a single functional block with its interfaces. The types of high-level requirements described in this section correspond roughly to these functions and interfaces. Functional requirements describe what happens inside the Clarus system itself: quality checking, development, and packaging of environmental data. Each interface to the Clarus system has its own requirements with regard to the collection of data from providers as input; the dissemination of data for output; the controlling rules and constraints under which the system operates; and the means (primarily data management) by which it works. Figure 8 – High-Level Requirements Context The high-level perspective assumed for these requirements has implications for downstream development activities. The high-level requirements provide a basis for components in system elaboration, and detailed requirements are subsequently tied to specific components. Conformance to high-level requirements is shown through testing based on plans derived from the detailed requirements. The entire development process is tied together by lines of traceability anchored in the high- level requirements. In this section, the requirements are classified by the first letter in the requirement identification as described in Table 2 and shown in Table 3. • Functional Requirements – Lists the characteristics that the system must support for each interface. Identifies what is to be done by the system, 04037-rq301srs0200 Copyright © 2005 Mixon/Hill, Inc. All rights reserved. Page 23 Clarus Weather System Design Detailed System Requirements Specification what inputs should be transformed to what outputs, and what specific operations are required. The functional requirements further include: • Functional Data Requirements, which describe requirements specific to the definition and management of data used and provided by the system; and • Functional Interface Requirements, which describe the functional interfaces to the Clarus system from information providers and consumers. • Performance Requirements – Specifies static and dynamic capacity for the number of users, connections, and other performance related factors. Performance requirements further include: • Design Constraints, which identify constraints imposed by standards, regulations, software or hardware limitations; and • Quality Requirements, which provide requirements which address the general quality, usability, extensibility, flexibility, and maintainability of the system. • Organizational Requirements – Includes requirements for policies and procedures to support the implementation, operations, training, and institutional requirements to support the system. This category also: • Details logical characteristics between the system and external data sources; • Specifies level of integration with external systems and defines the interfaces with each user class; and • Specifies any communications interfaces and protocols that should be supported. Table 2 shows the general layout of the requirements tables, and explains the purpose or content of each column of the requirements table. The requirements in this document are a subset of the requirements information that will be tracked in the system “Requirements Matrix.” While this document is intended to record the requirements that apply to a particular implementation of the system, the Requirements Matrix tracks all proposed requirements for the system. The matrix includes requirements that may apply to future versions of the system or which have been deferred due to cost or complexity. Table 3 provides an explanation of the requirement identification numbering system. The high-level requirements are identified as A-NNN, where A is the classification and NNN is a unique number. The detailed requirements are identified as A-NNNUU, where A-NNN is the parent or high-level requirement and UU is a unique identifier. This section lists the functional characteristics that the system must support. It also identifies what is to be done by the system, what inputs should be transformed to what outputs, and what specific operations are required. The 04037-rq301srs0200 Copyright © 2005 Mixon/Hill, Inc. All rights reserved. Page 24 Clarus Weather System Design Detailed System Requirements Specification functional requirements are broken into subsections by each allocation to specific modules listed in Table 4. Detailed requirements are associated with a parent or high-level requirement. They are used by developers in creating the design for the Clarus system, by testers to ensure all requirements are implemented during the build of the Clarus system, and by the client for documenting their expectations. Many of the high-level requirements are allocated to more than one module or component of the Clarus system. Within each table, the high-level requirements show their allocations to particular modules. If the high-level requirement is allocated to more than one module, then the high-level requirement will be repeated in the corresponding allocation’s module. Following the high-level requirement, detailed requirement(s) are shown to create more refined requirements specific to the associated module. Figure 7 may be referenced while reviewing the detailed requirements to maintain context of the Clarus system’s architecture. 04037-rq301srs0200 Copyright © 2005 Mixon/Hill, Inc. All rights reserved.

Page 89 Clarus Weather System Design Detailed System Requirements Specification APPENDIX B - SUPPLEMENTAL DESCRIPTION OF CLARUS QC TESTS The Clarus detailed requirements describe QC tests to be implemented as Clarus standard tests. This appendix provides descriptions of these QC test methods as a means of clarifying the intended implementations. These descriptions should not be interpreted, however, as further elaborations of requirements or as design specifications. The Clarus system design descriptions will provide the final specifications and will be subject to formal design review. Manual Quality Test The Clarus manual quality test allows authorized Clarus personnel to flag particular observations as “passed” or “failed” independent of the automated analysis. For instance, if a network manager communicates to Clarus that one of its stations has a temperature bias, then that station’s temperature data can be manually flagged as “failed” until the network corrects the problem. If a Clarus QA meteorologist determines that suspicious-looking snow depth data are from a real, meteorological event, that station’s snow depth can be manually flagged as “passed” until the event ends. Observations that have received manual quality checks need not be run through the automated quality checks (Fiebrich and Crawford 2001). Sensor Range Test The Clarus range test will flag any observation that lies outside of the pre- determined range threshold values as “failed”. The threshold values will usually be determined via sensor specifications or theoretical limits (Meek and Hatfield 1994). For instance, the range for relative humidity would likely be 0 to 100%. Observations that have received range filter flags of “failed” need not be run through the automated quality checks. Climate Test The Clarus climate test will flag any observation that exceeds defined, variable- specific climatological ranges as “failed” (Reek et al., 1992). Otherwise, the observation will be flagged as “passed”. The Clarus climatological threshold values will be station-specific and will be based on either regional extremes or individual station extremes (if they are available). Barnes Spatial Test The Clarus Barnes spatial test will calculate an estimate for each observation using a one-pass Barnes objective analysis routine (Barnes 1964, Shafer et al. 2000). Neighboring observations will be weighted according to their distance from the station that is being estimated: ∑w(r)z i i Z = , e ∑w(r) i 04037-rq301srs0100 Copyright © 2005 Mixon/Hill, Inc. All rights reserved. Page 90 Clarus Weather System Design Detailed System Requirements Specification where Z is the estimated value, z are the neighboring observations, and w is the e i weighting, based on the neighboring site’s distance to the site in question. The weighting decreases exponentially with distance from the station: −r2 i W(r)=e k o . i The weight function, k , is determined by the Barnes analysis based upon the o mean station spacing. The standard deviation, σ, of the observations within the radius of influence is calculated. The ratio of the difference between the observed (Z ) and estimated (Z ) values to the analysis’ standard deviation is defined as: o e Z −Z ∆ = e o. σ The Clarus Barnes spatial test will fail any observation whose value differs by more than three standard deviations from its estimated value (i.e., ∆ > 3). Otherwise, the Clarus Barnes spatial test will pass the observation, and list the ∆ value with the QC flag to indicate the confidence in the observation. For instance, a ∆ value of 1.5 would indicate that the observation was within 1.5 standard deviations of its expected value. Further analysis may indicate that the Barnes spatial test should have the ability to incorporate background fields (e.g., ADAS or RUC analysis from the previous hour) into the analysis to compensate for regions that have inadequate spatial or temporal coverage. Optimal Interpolation Spatial Test The Clarus Optimal Interpolation spatial test will calculate an estimate for each observation using a univariate optimal-interpolation technique (Belousov et al., 1968). Specifically, the test will use the nearest observation in each of eight directional sectors distributed around the observation (Miller and Benjamin, 1992). If the difference between the observation and estimate is “small”, the observation is flagged as “passed”, and the difference between the observation and the estimate is listed to indicate the confidence in the observation. The threshold for “small” is a function of the expected analysis error, which is dependent on location and density of the neighboring observations (Gandin, 1963, and Miller and Benjamin, 1991). If the difference is large, then neighboring observations are successively eliminated from the analysis to determine whether the discrepancy was caused by an erroneous observation from a neighboring site. If successively eliminating a neighboring station from the analysis results in a value that agrees with the observation, then the observation is flagged as “passed”. The difference between the observation and the estimate indicates the confidence in the observation. In addition, the suspicious neighboring observation is not used in the analysis of other stations. If successive eliminations of neighboring stations does not result in an estimated value that agrees with the observation, the observation is flagged as “failed”. The Clarus Optimal Interpolation spatial check will incorporate a background field (e.g., ADAS or RUC analysis from the previous hour) into the analysis to compensate for regions that have inadequate spatial or temporal coverage. Miller 04037-rq301srs0100 Copyright © 2005 Mixon/Hill, Inc. All rights reserved. Page 91 Clarus Weather System Design Detailed System Requirements Specification and Benjamin (1992) found that subtracting the background field before performing the analysis improved error detection. Step Test The Clarus step test will flag all observations whose consecutive values in time exceed predefined variable-specific step threshold values as “failed” (Fiebrich and Crawford 2001). For instance, if a pressure observation changes by greater than 10 hPa in five minutes, the observation is flagged as “failed”. As another example, if a temperature observation changes by greater than 10 °C in five minutes, the observation would be flagged as “failed”. Persistence Test The Clarus persistence test will flag all observations whose consecutive values in time remain the same for a predefined variable-specific persistence threshold value during a defined time interval as “failed” (Oklahoma Climatological Survey). For instance, if a pressure observation remains unchanged (to the nearest pascal) for more than 30 minutes, the observation would be flagged as “failed”. As another example, if a temperature observation remains unchanged (to the nearest tenth of a °C) for more than 120 minutes, the observation would be flagged as “failed”. Like Instrument Test The Clarus like instrument test will flag all observations that differ from the corresponding like-instrument observations by more than a predefined variable- specific threshold value as “failed” (Fiebrich and Crawford 2001). For instance, if the wind speed at 10 m differs from the wind speed at 2 m by more than 5 ms-1, then the observation would be flagged as “failed”. Potential Temperature Test The Clarus potential temperature test will flag all temperature observations whose potential temperatures fail the Clarus Optimal Interpolation spatial test as “failed”. Elevation differences will be incorporated to help model the horizontal correlation between mountain stations (Miller and Benjamin 1992). Dew Point Temperature Test The Clarus dew point temperature test will flag all temperature and relative humidity observations whose resulting dew point values fail the Clarus Barnes spatial test or the Clarus Optimal Interpolation spatial test as “failed” (Oklahoma Climatological Survey). Sea Level Pressure Test The Clarus sea level pressure test will flag all pressure observations whose computed sea level pressure values fail the Clarus Barnes spatial test or the Clarus Optimal Interpolation spatial test as “failed” (Oklahoma Climatological Survey). 04037-rq301srs0100 Copyright © 2005 Mixon/Hill, Inc. All rights reserved. Page 92 Clarus Weather System Design Detailed System Requirements Specification Theoretical Solar Radiation Test The Clarus theoretical solar radiation test will flag all downwelling short wave radiation observations whose values exceed the theoretical solar radiation for the site’s latitude, longitude, and day of year as “failed” (Oklahoma Climatological Survey). Precipitation Amount Test The Clarus precipitation amount test would flag all precipitation amount observations whose values differ from the radar-estimated precipitation amount by more than a pre-determined threshold as “failed”. The nearest or best radar to use for each location would be configurable. This technique is still being researched and is not recommended for Clarus proof-of-concept implementation (Oklahoma Climatological Survey). Wind Direction Test The Clarus wind direction test will function the same way as the Barnes and Optimal Interpolation spatial tests do, with the exception that wind direction estimates will be calculated from directional means (rather than arithmetic means). In addition, the wind direction observation will be subject to this test only if its associated wind speed observations are greater than 3 ms-1 (Oklahoma Climatological Survey). For instance, wind directions with associated wind speeds of 0-3 ms-1 will not be tested, because wind direction is highly variable during calm/light winds. Soil Moisture Change Test The Clarus soil moisture change test will function similarly to the step test except that different thresholds will be set for changes in moistening versus drying. For instance, the observations will be allowed to moisten more rapidly than they will be allowed to dry (Oklahoma Climatological Survey 2005). Soil Moisture Freeze Test The Clarus soil moisture freeze test will flag all observations whose associated subsurface temperatures are below freezing as “failed”. Most soil moisture sensors do not operate correctly when the soil is frozen (Oklahoma Climatological Survey 2005). 04037-rq301srs0100 Copyright © 2005 Mixon/Hill, Inc. All rights reserved.
