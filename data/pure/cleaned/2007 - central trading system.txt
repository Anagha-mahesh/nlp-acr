Introduction 1.1 Goals and objectives The central trading system (CTS) is to complete the trading of stock. It analyses the instructions that enter the central trading system and divides them into several kinds of instructions. System will make a match between them under specifically prescripts. Also central trading system provides some interfaces to send messages to other modules. 1.2 System Context The CTS is just a subsystem of the whole stock trading system (STS) system. There are mainly six subsystems involved, stock account operation, financing account operation, trade client serve, network message promulgating, centeral trading system and trading system manage. Communications exist among these subsystems which complicates the relationships between subsystems. The CTS receive instructions from trade client serve. Then the CTS produce new messages which to be sent to network message promulgating after deal with the instructions from trade client serve. Also the system manager is authorization to access the information in CTS. 1.3 Potential Users’ Specification There are mainly two kinds of users. The CTS provides the terminal users easy Operations that are confined to a series of mouse clicks and keyboard, which compared to other systems are really much simplified. However, for another user, things are different .the maintainers of this CTS must be familiar with java programming and the socket. When the system crashes down, they can find the cause and fix it. When new requirements should be supported, they can modify the program to make it fit. As the instruction is frequently operated in CTS such as fetch, deal with, repeal and so on, the CTS is heavily transferred. The program must take this into consideration. The maintainers of CTS should have good strategies to overcome crash of the system when overhead exceeds the capacity of it. 2. User Scenario 2.1 User Profiles There are mainly five kinds of actors, which here consist of other related sub-systems, involved with our Central Trading System. They are Transaction User Interface, Security 3 Version 1.0 Account Management, Trading Management System, Trading Information Release. 2.2 User Scenarios Specification 2.2.1 Personal Opinion Often, user-scenario is considered the same to use-case. They both can help our team understand how system functions and features will be used by different classes of end-users (actors). However, I prefer to understand it like this: a user scenario is a particular environment within a specified use case. So, I will specify user-scenarios going along with developing use cases in the next session. 2.2.2 Develop Use-Cases within which User-Scenarios are specified Use-case Buy stock Primary actor Transaction User Interface Goal in context To fulfill the buy transaction Customer has successfully logged into UI and submit the buy Preconditions information Trigger The ‘buy’ button on UI been clicked 1. transaction user interface: give the buy instruction 2. central trading system: save the buy instruction 3. central trading system: match the instructions with the Scenario same stock id 4. central trading system: make a trade by matching 5. central trading system: modify the information of matched instructions 1. all the operations have been suspended Exception 2. some trade exceptions come up 3. no matched stock with the buy instruction Priority Essential, must be implemented When available First increment Frequency of use Frequent Channel to actor Via transaction user interface Secondary actors Trading System Management Channels to Via central trading system interface secondary actors 4 Version 1.0 1.

Then the instructions will go to the instructions manager modular. This modular will deal with all the three kinds of instructions. Then it will send the results to the Trading client serve and information releasing modular as well as keep a log file. 3.3 Level 2 DFD for the instruction pretreatment 10 Version 1.0 The instructions analysis will identify the kind of the instructions. Then it will deal with the illegal instructions like the raising limit and freezing the fund in the Data Base. In addition, it will keep log file about the instructions. 3.4 Level-2 DFD of the instructions manager 11 Version 1.0 In this level the three kinds of instructions will go to three different modules. The query instruction will refer to the Data Base or the instructions list. The cancel instruction will delete the instruction the instruction in the instructions list. And the trade instruction will go to the trade manager to make a match in the instructions list. 4 Data Dictionary 12 Version 1.0 Name Alias When /how to use Description central trading receive the instructions and to accomplish the matching work of the stock CTS system return the result. trading system as well as the query.

There are several states in the diagram, which are decoding, researching, canceling, analyzing, rejecting, queuing, storing, matching, queue modifying, responding. The flow between the adjacent states goes their way according to specific conditions which are displayed on the flow line. 14 Version 1.0 6 CRC index cards Class: PretreatmentOfInstruction Description: After a new instruction come, we must get key information from instruction and solve some simple problems by necessary constraints and some key rules Responsibility: Collaborator: Determination of prices ’increments and decrements constraints of Instruction Freeze account of buyers ManagementOfDatabase Prededuct commission charge and tax ManagementOfDatabase Log instruction Send to Management of instruction ManagementOfInstruction Class: ManagementOfInstruction Description: Manage and maintain the instructions of buyers and sellers Responsibility: Collaborator: Add instructions Cancel instructions Search instructions Sort instructions Class: ManagementOfInstruction Class: ManagementOfDealing Description: Deal business following the key rules, and some operations are executed after the deals Responsibility: Collaborator: 15 Version 1.0 Deal the business Log the results of business Store some key data to database ManagementOfDatabase Determine the commission charge and tax Class: ManagementOfDatabase Description: Support the basic operations interface of database for other modules Responsibility: Collaborator: Operations of account, insert, delete, update Operations of stock, insert, delete, update 7 Validation Criteria 7.1 Interface criteria The central trading system has relation with three modules that are trading client serve、trading manager system、information releasing module. These modules have contact with CTS using the interface supplied by CTS. 7.1.1 Transaction User Interface The Transaction User Interface has to input the instructions. The input instruction is divided into three kinds: buy instruction, sell instruction and query instruction. a) buy instruction This instruction should have five parameters: user ID, stock ID, quantity, respected price, timestamp. b) sell instruction This instruction should have five parameters: user ID, stock ID, quantity, respected price, timestamp. c) query instruction This instruction can be divided into two kinds: user query instruction and the stock query instruction. The user query instruction should have three 16 Version 1.0 parameters: user ID, query content, some restrict parameters. The stock query instruction should has three parameters: stock ID，query content, some restrict parameter。 7.1.2 Information Releasing Module The information releasing module use the interface to find the price of the stocks. The input should has two parameters including the stock name and the restrict parameter. 7.1.3 Trading manager system The trading manager system uses the interface to find the user’s trading instruction. The input should has two parameters including the trading instruction type(buy or sell),and the restrict parameter. 7.2 Function Criteria The CTS deals with trading instruction, query instruction and some cancel instruction. The functions are as follows: 1) instruction matching When the client serve get a trading instruction, it will send the instruction to the CTS to trade with other trading instructions. The process of the trading includes the following two main principles: price first principle and the time first principle. If the trading fails when these two principles have been applied, we should refer to another principle. If the lowest buy price is higher than the highest sell price, then the CTS will make a match of this trading. 2) rising and falling limit If the trading price is higher(lower) than the rising limit (falling limit), the CTS will reject this trading instruction. 3) return the result The CTS will return the result to the client serve for any trading instructions than go into the CTS. The trading states are divided into two kinds: totally finished and the partially finished. 4) outdated instruction If a instruction haven ’t finished it’s trading in one day, then it will be removed form the CTS for out of date. 17 Version 1.0
